Title: Service details

1. Target Operation system: MAC OS X operating system

Afterwards, we add the executable in a specified location and send the SIGHUP signal to inetd, in order to tell it to reread its configuration file. For instance, one could put, my chat stream ump no wait ebony /home/ebony/udpser udpser.  If desired, you may verify  that a listening socket has been created on that port number using the command netstat.
